### Protect your browsing data
- Which mobile browser do you use and why? Are you happy with your mobile’s default browser? Let’s get to know it better. Have a look at the cookies that are currently stored on your browser. First, what are cookies? Cookies are files created by websites when you visit. They save information such as: browsing history, interactions with website elements, your preferences, your browser type, your location, etc.
